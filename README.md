# MetroDraw

MetroDraw is a WIP desktop app for drawing transit maps.

## Goals

MetroDraw hopes to be able to eventually reproduce the map of any transit system, though not necessarily in the same style, and export it to either a bitmap or a vector image. As is, it is quite rudimentary, and lacks much functionality.

## Use

MetroDraw is based on different editing modes.

- To **a**dd stations, press `a` and click on the map. This is the default mode when you start the app.
- To **d**raw transit lines, press `d` and drag between two or more stations.
- To switch between lines, use the number keys (1 through 9, and 0). Six colors are currently available.
- To **r**emove stations, press `r` and click on a station.
